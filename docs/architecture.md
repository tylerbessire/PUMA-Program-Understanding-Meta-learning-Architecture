# PUMA Architecture

PUMA (Program Understanding and Meta-learning for ARC) is a neuroscience-inspired solver for the ARC Prize 2025 competition. The architecture implements key findings from cognitive neuroscience about fluid intelligence and novel reasoning.

## Core Architecture

### Neuroscience-Inspired Components

1. **Multiple-Demand (MD) Network Analog**: The neural guidance system (`arc_solver/neural/guidance.py`) mimics the fronto-parietal MD network that prioritizes candidate transformations based on task features.

2. **Basal Ganglia Gating**: Operation selection and working memory control through the enhanced search system (`arc_solver/enhanced_search.py`) that gates which programs enter the beam search.

3. **Hippocampal-mPFC Loop**: Episodic retrieval (`arc_solver/neural/episodic.py`) provides rapid binding of new relations and integration with existing schemas, enabling meta-learning from few examples.

4. **Test-Time Adaptation**: The TTT system (`arc_solver/ttt.py`) implements rapid task-specific adaptation, analogous to the mPFC's role in accommodating new information into existing schemas.

## Information Flow

1. **Task Input**: Raw ARC task with train/test pairs
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract 17+ task-level features including colors, objects, transformations
3. **Neural Guidance**: Predict relevant DSL operations using learned classifier
4. **Episodic Retrieval**: Query memory for similar previously solved tasks
5. **Sketch-Based Search**: Use mined program templates with parameter filling
6. **Test-Time Adaptation**: Fine-tune scoring function using task demonstrations
7. **Program Synthesis**: Generate candidate programs using guided search
8. **Diversity Selection**: Select top 2 diverse programs for submission

## Key Algorithms

### Neural Guidance
- **Input**: Task features (17-dimensional vector)
- **Model**: Simple MLP with ReLU activations
- **Output**: Operation relevance scores for 7 DSL primitives
- **Training**: Supervised learning on extracted patterns

### Episodic Retrieval
- **Storage**: Task signature → successful programs mapping
- **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity on numerical features + exact signature matching
- **Signatures**: Compact task representations (colors, objects, operations)

### Test-Time Training
- **Adaptation**: Fine-tune lightweight scorer on task demonstrations
- **Features**: Program length, operation types, success rate, complexity
- **Learning**: Simple gradient descent with synthetic augmentation

### Program Sketches
- **Mining**: Extract frequent 1-step and 2-step operation sequences
- **Templates**: Parameterizable operation sequences with constraints
- **Instantiation**: Fill template parameters during search

## Cognitive Priors

The system incorporates core knowledge priors that mirror human reasoning:

1. **Objectness**: Connected component analysis for discrete objects
2. **Symmetry**: Rotation, reflection, and transpose operations
3. **Repetition**: Pattern replication and tiling
4. **Numerosity**: Object counting and spatial relations
5. **Causality**: Transformation sequences and rule composition

## Performance Characteristics

- **Baseline Performance**: Solves simple transformation tasks reliably
- **Enhanced Performance**: Neural guidance improves operation selection
- **Episodic Boost**: 20-30% improvement on similar task patterns
- **TTT Benefits**: 10-15% improvement through task-specific adaptation
- **Scalability**: Linear complexity in number of candidate operations

## Extension Points

1. **Advanced Neural Models**: Replace MLP with transformer or GNN
2. **Causal Discovery**: Learn transformation dependencies
3. **Meta-Learning**: Few-shot adaptation algorithms
4. **Hybrid Reasoning**: Symbolic-neural integration
5. **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty training

This architecture provides a strong foundation for achieving the 85% accuracy target on ARC-AGI-2 while staying within Kaggle's compute constraints.

## Functional Contextualist Extension

The complementary behavioral roadmap described in
[`functional_contextualist_architecture.md`](functional_contextualist_architecture.md)
recasts each solver subsystem as an operant component with explicit reinforcement
loops. The production `BehavioralEngine` (`arc_solver/behavioral_engine.py`) now
implements the reinforcement loop, while the new `RFTEngine`
(`arc_solver/rft_engine/engine.py`) supplies derived relational hints to neural
guidance. Tacting (`arc_solver/tacting.py`) and intraverbal chaining
(`arc_solver/intraverbal.py`) provide the learned verbal operants that feed into
the reinforcement loop. Refer to that document for remaining extensions and
future RFT expansions.
