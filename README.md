# PUMA: Program Understanding & Meta-learning Architecture

This repository contains an advanced solver for the **ARC Prize 2025** competition (ARC‑AGI‑2), implementing the complete blueprint from neuroscience-inspired research. It combines symbolic reasoning with neural guidance, episodic retrieval, program sketches, and test-time training to achieve superior performance on abstract reasoning tasks.

## Behavioral Approach with Relational Frame Theory

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/rft_behavioral_approach.svg" alt="Behavioral RFT approach" width="400"/>
</p>

We are implementing a behavioral perspective grounded in **Relational Frame Theory (RFT)** to tackle ARC through explicit relational reasoning. RFT models cognition as networks of learned relational frames, providing a principled foundation for understanding spatial and contextual relationships between objects.

### RFT Implementation Strategy

Our RFT approach focuses on learning explicit relational contexts between objects:

- **Relational Fact Extraction**: Parse visual scenes to identify objects and their spatial relationships (e.g., “blue square is always at top position”)
- **Contextual Rule Learning**: Extract invariant relationships across training examples (e.g., “if blue square at top, then red square at position (blue_y + 1, blue_x)”)
- **Compositional Reasoning**: Combine learned relational frames to generate predictions for novel configurations
- **Behavioral Generalization**: Apply relational rules systematically rather than relying on pattern matching

This approach complements the neural components by providing explicit, interpretable relational knowledge that can be composed and reasoned about symbolically.

For more details, see <profile/README.md>.

## Key Features

### Neuroscience-Inspired Architecture

- **Neural guidance**: Predicts relevant DSL operations using task features
- **Episodic retrieval**: Maintains database of solved tasks for analogical reasoning
- **Program sketches**: Mines common operation sequences as macro-operators
- **Test-time training**: Adapts scoring functions to each specific task
- **Multi-demand network analog**: Prioritizes candidate programs using learned heuristics

### Enhanced Capabilities

- **Object-centric parsing** with connected component analysis
- **Compact DSL** with composable primitives (rotate, flip, translate, recolor, etc.)
- **Relational reasoning** through explicit fact extraction and rule learning
- **Two-attempt diversity** as required by ARC Prize 2025 rules
- **Fallback resilience** with graceful degradation to baseline methods
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed statistics and benchmarking
- **Beam search with constraint propagation** for deeper program synthesis

```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage (Kaggle-ready)

```bash
# Generate submission file (uses enhanced solver by default)
python arc_submit.py

# Use baseline solver only (if needed)
ARC_USE_BASELINE=1 python arc_submit.py
```

### Training Neural Components

```bash
# Train neural guidance (requires training data)
python tools/train_guidance.py

# Or setup environment with defaults
python tools/benchmark.py
```

### Operant Behavioral Training

```bash
# Enable the behavioural loop (feature-flagged for safety)
export PUMA_BEHAVIORAL_ENGINE=1

# Run reinforcement training with default dataset paths
python -c "from pathlib import Path;\
from arc_solver.behavioral_engine import BehavioralEngine;\
engine = BehavioralEngine();\
engine.train(Path('data/arc-agi_training_challenges.json'), Path('data/arc-agi_training_solutions.json'), max_tasks=10)"
```

The command above executes the production `BehavioralEngine`, emitting structured
JSON logs with reward metrics while updating neural guidance and episodic memory
online. Unset `PUMA_BEHAVIORAL_ENGINE` to leave runtime behaviour unchanged.

### Python API

```python
from arc_solver.solver import solve_task_enhanced, ARCSolver

# Solve a single task with full enhancements
result = solve_task_enhanced(task)

# Configure solver behavior
solver = ARCSolver(use_enhancements=True)
result = solver.solve_task(task)
```

### Public Evaluation Runner

```bash
scripts/eval_public.sh
```

Or via Makefile:

```bash
make eval_public
```

## How It Works

### Enhanced Pipeline

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract task-level features (colors, objects, transformations)
1. **Relational Context Analysis**: Identify spatial and contextual relationships between objects using RFT principles
1. **Neural Guidance**: Predict which DSL operations are likely relevant
1. **Episodic Retrieval**: Query database for similar previously solved tasks
1. **Sketch-Based Search**: Use mined program templates with parameter filling
1. **Rule-Based Reasoning**: Apply learned relational facts to generate candidate solutions
1. **Test-Time Adaptation**: Fine-tune scoring function using task demonstrations
1. **Program Selection**: Rank and select top 2 diverse candidate programs

### Fallback Strategy

If enhanced components fail, the solver gracefully falls back to:

- Heuristic single-step transformations
- Brute-force enumeration of 2-step programs
- Identity transformation as last resort

## Configuration

The solver supports extensive configuration through environment variables and config files:

### Environment Variables

- `ARC_USE_BASELINE=1`: Force baseline solver only
- `ARC_DISABLE_ENHANCEMENTS=1`: Disable enhanced features

### Configuration File

```json
{
  "use_neural_guidance": true,
  "use_episodic_retrieval": true,
  "use_program_sketches": true,
  "use_test_time_training": true,
  "max_programs": 256,
  "timeout_per_task": 30.0
}
```

## Neural Components

### Neural Guidance

- **Architecture**: Simple MLP with task-level features
- **Training**: Uses extracted features from training demonstrations
- **Output**: Operation relevance scores to guide search

### Episodic Retrieval

- **Purpose**: Reuse solutions from similar previously solved tasks
- **Method**: Task signature matching with feature-based similarity
- **Storage**: JSON-based database of solved programs with metadata
- **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity on numerical features + boolean feature matching

### Program Sketches

- **Purpose**: Capture common operation sequences as reusable templates
- **Mining**: Extract frequent 1-step and 2-step operation patterns
- **Usage**: Instantiate sketches with different parameter combinations
- **Adaptation**: Learn from successful programs during solving

### Test-Time Training

- **Purpose**: Adapt scoring function to each specific task
- **Method**: Fine-tune lightweight scorer on task demonstrations
- **Features**: Program length, operation types, success rate, complexity
- **Augmentation**: Generate synthetic training examples via transformations

## Performance and Evaluation

### Benchmarking

```python
from benchmark import Benchmark, SolverConfig

config = SolverConfig()
benchmark = Benchmark(config)
results = benchmark.run_benchmark("test_data.json")
print(f"Success rate: {results['performance_stats']['success_rate']:.3f}")
```

### Monitoring

The solver tracks detailed statistics:

- Success rates for enhanced vs baseline methods
- Component usage (episodic hits, neural guidance, TTT adaptation)
- Timing breakdown per component
- Failure mode analysis

## Implementation Notes

### Kaggle Compatibility

- **Offline execution**: No internet access required
- **Dependency-light**: Uses only NumPy for core operations
- **Compute budget**: Optimized for ~$0.42 per task limit
- **Output format**: Exactly 2 attempts per test input as required

### Code Quality
